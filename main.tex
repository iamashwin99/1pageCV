\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
%\begin{tightemize}
%\item Bla Bla
%\end{tightemize}

\begin{tightemize}
    \item Simulation of reticle based IR seeker missile and its counter measure in MATLAB (15 days internship at DARE,DRDO)
    \item Design of a cryogenic probe for transport measurements and using it to observe Superconducting transition of Niobium Nitrate (2 Months internship at NISER).
    
    \item Measurement of low temperature Seebeck coefficient of different metals as a function of temperature under the guidance of a PhD scholar.
    \item Identification of superconducting transition of Yttrium barium copper oxide under the guidance of a PhD scholar.
    \item Determination of temperature of stars by analysing images obtained from a simple camera. 
 
 \item \textbf{A Novel Stove Stand:} 
   Designed and built an LPG Gas stove stand which harnessed the otherwise  wasted heat energy 
 during cooking into electricity (about 20W). It also reduced the cooking time. 
 \item \textbf{Pressure sensitive mat:}
    To make a mat that can sense touch enabling the determination of  different poses such as Running, Jumping, Rightward-leftward movement,one leg hop etc.( \textit{Worked in electronics and algorithm design }) 
    \item Past electronics team member of \textbf{Hyperloop India} and \textbf{Project Kratos}.
